# Make a cool diagram with RAW

When you filled out your questionnaire last week, you gave me some data! We'll use your responses to make a cool diagram that's really good at showing correlations.

## Download your data

Download your responses to the questionnaire here: [http://bit.ly/dh101responses.](http://bit.ly/dh101responses) (When you create a form with Google Forms, you can download the answers in a spreadsheet. That's all this is.)

## Choose the visualization type

After you've dropped your spreadsheet in the box, scroll down until you get to the list of chart types. There are lots of cool charts you can choose, and you should try them all when you can! For now, though, choose **Alluvial Diagram**.

## Add some dimensions

This is where you tell RAW which categories of your data you want to visualize. Choose a couple of the categories and drop them in the **Steps** box. You can leave **Size** blank.

## Scroll down to see your chart!

"Alluvial" refers to the sediment deposited by rivers, and you can see why! This diagram shows you how the categories on the left are related to the categories on the right. Cool, huh!
